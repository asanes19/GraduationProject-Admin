The project is a web application with two sides‚Äîa website and a management system‚Äîcreated for a used car showroom. Customers can view available cars on the website, learn about the showroom, sell their cars, request a particular car, and take part in car auctions. The Virtual Test Drive and the 360 Interior Tour are two additional distinctive features on the website. Staff members can control every aspect of the management system, including adding and displaying data about cars and customers, selling cars, and producing monthly reports. A variety of web development tools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL, and SiwperJS, were used to create the application. 
A database is connected to the website and management system, enabling effective data management and retrieval. The project aims to improve customer satisfaction and streamline showroom operations, making it simpler for customers to find and buy the cars they want and giving staff efficient management tools.
